# 🫀 Heart Attack Analyzer - ML Project

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a heart attack using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to assist in early detection by analyzing patient health metrics and applying classification models.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death globally. With timely prediction and analysis, many lives can be saved. This project builds a predictive model using real-world patient data to estimate the risk of a heart attack.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset contains patient-level information such as:
- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol Level
- Blood Pressure, Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina, Oldpeak, and more

(Data is either from [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) or simulated for academic purposes.)

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Compared the performance of multiple ML models.
- Achieved an accuracy of ~XX% (replace with your actual result).
- Visualized feature importance and decision boundaries.

## 🔍 Future Scope
- Deploy the model via Streamlit or Flask for interactive prediction.
- Improve accuracy using ensemble methods or deep learning.

## 📷 Sample Visuals
(Add screenshots of your EDA, confusion matrix, etc. if available.)
